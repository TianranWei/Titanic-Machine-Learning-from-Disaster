# Titanic: Machin Learning from Disaster
# Introduction

At the start of any Data Science project, understanding of the context and case at hand is key. In an enterprise setting, this would be business and domain understanding.

Before I started working with the data, I decided to do some research on the Titanic.

The facts above outline some interesting theories as to why the disaster occured. Was it a coincidence? Was somebody to blame?...

Below is a timeline based on the local time of the ship, from construction to survival - for some. The speed at which the disaster developed once they were hit,  was astonishing.

- From the information presented above, it is clear that there are certain factors that may have caused the disaster. However, there are also clearly factors that helped to improve a passengers chance of survival, such as **social standing** and **gender**.
- Hence, I have created this kernel to demonstrate a Demo into the range of **Machine Learning** techniques available to **predict survival**. I will walk you through the entire Data Science process to try to figure out what hides behind the famous disaster.
